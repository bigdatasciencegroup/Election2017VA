An analysis in R of the 2017 UK General Election results, focusing on the relationship between demographics and the performance of the Labour Party

This is a piece of analysis I carried out for the Visual Analytics module of my MSc Data Science course. It looks at the relationship 
between the demographic makeup of UK parliamentary constituencies and the way they voted in the 2015 and 2017 UK General Election, 
how these relationships vary across the country, and what this might mean for the two major UK political parties. If you don't want 
to read the entire report (understandable - it's nealry 4000 words long), I have sumarised the work in an article for Towards Data Science 
(https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-demographic-changes-in-the-uk-labour-partys-vote-with-visual-analytics-42cb5e8b6b2d).
